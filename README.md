Code from Undergraduate projects 
Project #1 was in R and is therefore not in this repository 

Project #2: Creating a ML model to predict equilibrium reactions 
The project itself focused on predicting the equilibrium constant in chemical reactions between different acids and bases. 
There was no data that could be found for the topic given so it was synthesized for 6 different reactions with different amounts. 
Because it was synthesized the ML model was really just recreating the synthesis equation backward to find the equilibrium constant. 
Given more time and resources the project would have taken real life data from a chemistry lab.
